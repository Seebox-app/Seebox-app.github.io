      </h1>

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&#34;DNT&#34;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized.
      </p>

      <p>
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
        in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this Privacy Notice.
