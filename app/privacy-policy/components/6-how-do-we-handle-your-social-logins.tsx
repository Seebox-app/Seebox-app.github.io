        <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our
        Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain
        information about you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform. If you log in using
        Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to
        your account, such as your friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may
        choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
